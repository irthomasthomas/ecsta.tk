# This website was built by Thomas Hughes as a prototype demonstration of Redis AI.
# The server scrapes instagram posts in to a redis database
# Each post is then automatically fed to a machine learning pipeline and redis AI classifies each post
# Relevant posts that match the machine learning model are saved and made available on the site ecsta.tk
